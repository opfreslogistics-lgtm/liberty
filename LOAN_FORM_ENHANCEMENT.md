# Loan Form Enhancement Guide

Due to the large file size, I'll provide the complete professional form steps that need to be integrated. The form should have:

1. **Step 1: Loan Type** (Already exists - keep as is)
2. **Step 2: Personal Information** - Replace current Step 2
3. **Step 3: Employment Information** - Replace current Step 3
4. **Step 4: Financial Information** - New step
5. **Step 5: Loan Details & Documents** - Replace current Step 2 content
6. **Step 6: Review & Consent** - Replace current Step 4

The form needs professional file upload components with previews, validation, and elegant styling.
